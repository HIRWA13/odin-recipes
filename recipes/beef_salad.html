    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup lime juice</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
      <li>1 stalk lemongrass, smashed and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 Â½ pounds (1 inch thick) steak fillet</li>
      <li>
        1 head leaf lettuce - rinsed, dried and torn into bite-size pieces
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix lime juice, cilantro, mint leaves, sugar, fish sauce, green onions,
        lemongrass, and chili sauce together in a large bowl until sugar is
        dissolved. Adjust the flavor, if desired, by adding more sugar and/or
        fish sauce; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Cook steak on the preheated grill until it begins to firm and is hot and
        slightly pink in the center, about 4 to 6 minutes per side. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140
        degrees F (60 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place lettuce in a salad bowl; arrange cucumber on top. Add steak and
        pour all of the herb mixture on top. Scatter cherry tomatoes over salad
        and garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir cooled noodle mixture into dressing. Pour dressing over
        coleslaw-onion mixture; toss to coat.
      </li>
    </ol>
